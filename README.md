>Card columns

>Cards can be organized into Masonry-like columns with just CSS by wrapping them in .card-columns. Cards are built with CSS column properties instead of flexbox for easier alignment. Cards are ordered from top to bottom and left to right.

>Heads up! Your mileage with card columns may vary. To prevent cards breaking across columns, we must set them to display: inline-block as column-break-inside: avoid isnâ€™t a bulletproof solution yet. [Source](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/card/)
